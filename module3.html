            In this section we will discuss the three main forms of proofs most commonly used in computer science and mathematics as a whole, as well as why proofs are so useful.
            These include the following: <br><br>
            1: Direct Proofs <br>
            2: Proof by Contradiction <br>
            3: Proof by Mathematical Induction <br><br>
            Of these styles of proofs, the third is perhaps the most difficult proof style to learn.
            This proof style is discussed in section 5. 
            Direct proofs are perhaps the most straight forward. 
            A direct proof involves making a series of logical statements that taken in order arrive on a logical proof of how something is correct. 
            We will discuss direct proofs more in section 3. 
            Proof by contradiction is our second form of proof. 
            Proof by contradiction involves finding an example that proves that a statement does not hold true. 
            This is particularly useful when proving an algorithm is incorrect for all inputs. 
            Proof by contradiction is not typically useful for proving an algorithm correct, however. 
            We will discuss proof by contradiction in section 4. 
            Finally proof by induction represents our third and typically most commonly accepted form of mathematical proof. 
            Proof by induction involves proving an algorithm holds true for three cases: a base case, an arbitrary n case, and an n+1 case. 
            This style of proof allows us to prove an algorithm correct for arbitrary inputs. 
            We will discuss this style of proof more in section 5. 
            <br><br>

            Proofs serve a range of purposes in computer science. 
            One of the most common uses for proofs is proving the correctness of an algorithm. 
            When one develops an algorithm or a solution to a problem, it is generally important to prove that the solution is sound. 
            Where with conventional code we often simply test the code using a range of test cases, with algorithms, we often need to go a step further. 
            Algorithms development typically requires the development of a rigerous proof for why the algorithm is sound for all possible range of values that it needs to work with. 
            Consider the Depth First Search algorithm. 
            There exists an inductive proof that this algorithm will work correctly for any graph. 
            This means that we can trust depth first search for any graph that we need to traverse and find an element on.

          Proofs are less complex than they seem. 
          What often confuses people when learning proofs is simply the language that is most commonly used when writing proofs.
          The main thing to keep in mind when reading or writing a proof of any of the three types we'll discuss is that the goal is the make sure that our language is very clear and precise. 
          The goal of proofs is to ensure that the language used cannot be misinterpreted and the meaning is objective. 
          Firstly, we need to define what our proof system or language will be. 
          Lets call this proof system <em>S</em>. 
          The first component of our proof system is our language. 
          This language <em>L</em> can be in one of two different styles. 
          The first is propositional, wherein the language is composed of logical statements that have some sort of truth value (true or false).
          The second is predicate based, wherein the language is composed of informative statements that qualify or provide more information about the element we are trying to prove. 
          We also accept that we will make our proof out of a set of formulas <em>F</em> that are described in the language <em>L</em>.
          We also accept that this will be extended to include a set of expressions <em>E</em> that will be built out of our language <em>L</em>.
          <br><br>
          What does all of this mean? 
          The goal of a proof is to define with logical statements a sequence of statements that will prove something with certainty. 
          Our goal with the above logic is to carefully spell out what goes into a proof. 
          Our proofs have a specific system of logic, a set of logical statements that will compose the proof, and a set of rules <em>R</em> that will govern how we define the proof. 
          This is just a brief introduction to our proof systems and how we specify and define them.
          Linked at the end of this section are a number of examples for these systems and how we express them.
          <br><br>
          Let us now consider some basic symbols commonly used in proofs. <br>
          = (the equals sign) means “is the same as” <br>
          < (the less than sign) means “is strictly less than” <br>
          > (the greater than sign) means "is strictly greater than" <br>
          ≤ (the less than or equal sign) means "is less than or equal to" <br>
          ≥ (“greater than or equals”) <br>
          &#8788; means "is equal by definition to" <br><br>
          &there4; means "therefore"<br>
          &ni; (the such that sign) means "under the condition that" <br>
          &rArr; (the implies sign) means "logically implies that" <br>
          ⇐⇒ (the iff sign) means "if and only if" <br>
          &forall; means "for all" (universal quantifier) <br>
          &exist; means "there exists" (the existential quantifier) <br>
          &#8708; means "there does not exist" <br>
          &#8718; means "QED or end of proof"
          <br><br>
          &sub; means "subset of" <br>
          &isin; means "is included in" <br>
          &cup; means "union" or combination of two sets <br>
          &cap; means "intersection" or difference of two sets<br>
          &empty; means "the empty set" somtimes referred to as the null set.<br>
          &infin; means infinity <br>
          <br>
          More symbols can be found discussed in the links included at the end of this section, though this represents many of the common ones you will work with. <br><br>
