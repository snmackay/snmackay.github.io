            This module contains resources for learning about proofs of correctness as well as runtime proofs. 
            
            <br><br>
            The module contains multiple sections beginning with a discussion of proof styles.
            <br><br>
            It is best to start with Section 1.

            In this section we will discuss the three main forms of proofs most commonly used in computer science and mathematics as a whole, as well as why proofs are so useful.
            These include the following: <br><br>
            1: Direct Proofs <br>
            2: Proof by Contradiction <br>
            3: Proof by Mathematical Induction <br><br>
            Of these styles of proofs, the third is perhaps the most difficult proof style to learn.
            This proof style is discussed in section 5. 
            Direct proofs are perhaps the most straight forward. 
            A direct proof involves making a series of logical statements that taken in order arrive on a logical proof of how something is correct. 
            We will discuss direct proofs more in section 3. 
            Proof by contradiction is our second form of proof. 
            Proof by contradiction involves finding an example that proves that a statement does not hold true. 
            This is particularly useful when proving an algorithm is incorrect for all inputs. 
            Proof by contradiction is not typically useful for proving an algorithm correct, however. 
            We will discuss proof by contradiction in section 4. 
            Finally proof by induction represents our third and typically most commonly accepted form of mathematical proof. 
            Proof by induction involves proving an algorithm holds true for three cases: a base case, an arbitrary n case, and an n+1 case. 
            This style of proof allows us to prove an algorithm correct for arbitrary inputs. 
            We will discuss this style of proof more in section 5. 
            <br><br>

            Proofs serve a range of purposes in computer science. 
            One of the most common uses for proofs is proving the correctness of an algorithm. 
            When one develops an algorithm or a solution to a problem, it is generally important to prove that the solution is sound. 
            Where with conventional code we often simply test the code using a range of test cases, with algorithms, we often need to go a step further. 
            Algorithms development typically requires the development of a rigerous proof for why the algorithm is sound for all possible range of values that it needs to work with. 
            Consider the Depth First Search algorithm. 
            There exists an inductive proof that this algorithm will work correctly for any graph. 
            This means that we can trust depth first search for any graph that we need to traverse and find an element on.
